# divvy

The bulk of the data for this project came from https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data. 

The goal of this project was to visualize the movements of shared bikes through the Divvy Bike system in a way that was clear and intuitive for a lay reader. I achieved this using two different methods:
  1. A sankey diagram to show the primary inflows and outflows for a certain station.
  2. A chord diagram to show how bikes moved between the wards of Chiacago.
  
The second tool has the additional benefit of simultaneously visualizing the wards where Divvy Bike is the most actively used. 

Many thanks to Shahin Rostami for his wonderful python wrapper of the D3 chord diagram visualizer.
